    You just had a million-dollar idea, and all you need is the help of someone with the skills to bring that idea to life. Or you've just learned something amazing and want the opportunity to apply your knowledge to a practical project. Yale is full of talented, creative people. We want to help you work together to make great things happen!

  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-4 col-sm-12 lg-margin">
      <p class="larger-body blue no-space">① Create a project </p> 
      <p class="larger-body med-margin"> Tell Yale what you're working on and why it's an awesome project.</p>
    </div>
    <div  class="col-md-4 col-sm-12 lg-margin">
      <p class="larger-body blue no-space">② Make an opening</p>
      <p class="larger-body med-margin ">These are the specific roles you're looking to fill, what the time commitment is, what skills are required, and how much (and if) you're compensating.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div  class="col-md-4 col-sm-12 lg-margin">
      <p class="larger-body blue no-space">③ Check your email</p>
      <p class="larger-body med-margin ">Your openings will now start appearing in people's feeds, and they'll reach out to you via email to express their interest!</p>

    <p class="larger-body">Everything you post is protected by CAS Login, which means it is visible to the Yale community but no one else. To ensure quality, every project is reviewed by an admin before it gets posted. The approval process doesn't take more than a day, and you'll be notified via email when your project is up.</p>
