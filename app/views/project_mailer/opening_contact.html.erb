    Great news from the Yale Projects Board!
  </p>
  <p>
    <%= @user.full_name %> (cc'd) has expressed interest in your posting 
    <a href="<%= ENV['BASE_URL'] %>/projects/<%= @project.id %>"><%= @opening.name %></a>. 
  </p>
  <p>
    The next step would be to view their 
    <a href="<%= ENV['BASE_URL'] %>/profile/<%= @user.netid %>">profile page</a> or send them at email at <%= @user.email %>. We hope this leads to a fruitful relationship!

    All the best,
