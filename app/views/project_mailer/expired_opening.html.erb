    Your opening <%= @opening.name %> in the project <%= @opening.project.name %> has expired. This means that the opening will no longer be shown in search results, and people will not be able to contact you to join.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you're still looking to fill this opening, then you can go to <a href="<%= ENV['BASE_URL'] %>/projects/<%= @opening.project.id %>">the project page</a> and renew it. Otherwise, no action is necessary.

    Thank you!
